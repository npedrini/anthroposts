		<span class='quote'>AnthroPosts <span class='emphasis'>offers quiet insight into the most mundane reality of people’s lives</span>, tickling your imagination to fill the voids in the process. And while privacy crusaders would no doubt frown, <span class='emphasis'>we love the lean-back voyeurism the project exudes</span>. Mostly, we love that AnthroPosts <span class='emphasis'>feeds our hard-wired human tendency to look for patterns in everything</span>, to build storytelling around even the most barren of narrative landscapes and create meaning where there’s only a hint thereof.</span>
